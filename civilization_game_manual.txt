CIVILIZATION
Complete Expert Rulebook (Final Printable Edition)
1. INTRODUCTION
Civilization is a strategy card-and-dice game about building a powerful empire without letting it
collapse under its own weight. You are not only competing against other players—you are
fighting internal pressures such as population strain, civil unrest, rebellion, famine, and economic
collapse.
Military strength alone will not win the game. Large armies increase population. Population
increases unrest. Unrest leads to rebellion. Victory belongs to the ruler who can expand,
dominate, and still keep their civilization stable.
Wars are not decided in a single battle. Civilizations fall slowly through siege, exhaustion, and
internal revolt.
2. OBJECTIVE
The game ends when only one civilization remains and that civilization successfully survives
two full additional rounds without:
• A rebellion
• An economic collapse
If the final civilization fails, the game continues among the remaining players.
3. COMPONENTS
Each player has:
• One personal civilization deck (never mixed with others)
• Two Emergency Cards (face down, unknown)
• Dice (shared or personal)
• A stat tracker (paper, board, or sheet)
4. CORE STATS
Each civilization is defined by seven core stats, all of which must be tracked:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Civil Unrest – instability and rebellion risk
Economy – total value of red cards in hand
Military – total value of black cards in hand
Food – produced by farms and stored
Luxury – purchased with economy, boosts morale
Morale – recalculated each round
Population – recalculated each round
5. SETUP
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Each player shuffles their personal deck
Each player draws 4 starting cards
Each player receives 2 Emergency Cards, placed face down
All stats begin at 0
Choose a starting player randomly
6. CARDS AND HAND LIMIT
• Red cards contribute to Economy
• Black cards contribute to Military
Card values:
• Ace = 1
• Number cards = face value
• Face cards = 10
You may never hold more than 10 cards in your hand.
Discarding:
• You may only discard during the Discard & Cleanup Phase
• You must discard immediately if over the limit
Cards are never traded between players.
7. ROUND STRUCTURE
Each round follows the same phases, in this exact order.
All players must complete a phase before moving to the next.
PHASE 1: UPKEEP PHASE (SIMULTANEOUS)
1. Food Production
Each farm produces 20 food, unless under siege.
2. Morale Calculation
Morale = Luxury + Food at the start of the round
2.
3. Population Calculation
Population =
⌊ (Luxury × √Food) ÷ (Morale ÷ 10 + 1) ⌋
+ Military
3.
4. Population Pressure Unrest
o Population 30–49 → +2 Unrest
o Population 50–74 → +4 Unrest
o Population 75–99 → +7 Unrest
o Population 100+ → +10 Unrest
PHASE 2: INTERNAL PRESSURE PHASE
Automatic Unrest Gains
• Food Stress
o If Food < Population x 2 → +5 Unrest
o If Food < Population x 4 → +10 Unrest instead
• Siege Pressure
o +8 Unrest per round under siege
• Economic Collapse Pressure
o If you have 0 economy cards → +10 Unrest per round
Civil Unrest Threshold Effects
• 30+ Unrest – Lose 1 State Action
• 50+ Unrest – No trading or buying luxury
• 75+ Unrest – Vulnerable to Foreign Interference
• 100+ Unrest – Rebellion begins immediately
Foreign Interference
• Available at 75+ Unrest
• 1 economy → +1 unrest
• Each player may interfere once per round
• Maximum +10 unrest per target per round
PHASE 3: STATE ACTION PHASE (TURN ORDER)
You may take up to 2 State Actions, minus penalties.
Only one action per category per round.
Action categories:
• Economic: Buy cards, farms, or luxury
• Military: Commit troops, declare war
• Domestic: Reduce unrest, stabilize population
• Diplomatic: Trades, treaties
• Emergency: Play Emergency Cards
ECONOMY & PURCHASING
• Cards: 2 economy per card
• Farms: 5 economy
• Luxury: 1 economy per luxury
Luxury rolls:
• Each luxury purchased = 1 die roll
• Add results to luxury pool
Economic Collapse
If you have 0 economy cards, choose:
o Draw emergency card +30 unrest if card drawn is red nothing happens, if card
drawn is black then civil unrest +30
Or
o +20 unrest
PHASE 4: WAR PHASE (TURN ORDER)
Wars create a War Track starting at 0.
Military Commitment
Military cards are assigned to:
• Frontline
• Garrison (+2 rebellion suppression per card)

OCCUPATION RULE (NEW)
When a civilization collapses, the conquering player must immediately assign an Occupation
Force.
• Minimum occupation: 10 military value
• Occupation troops are removed from your available military
• Occupied civilizations:
o Generate +5 Unrest per round for the occupier
o May trigger rebellion if occupation is too weak
If occupation troops are withdrawn:
• The conquered civilization immediately rebels
Occupation forces may only be removed if:
• The game ends
• The civilization is fully stabilized by special effects
PHASE 5: REBELLION PHASE (UPDATED)
When Unrest reaches 100+, a rebellion begins.
Rebellion Track
• Rebellion starts at 2
• If the track reaches 0 → rebellion is crushed
• If the track reaches 6 → civilization collapses
