# Civilization Online

Online multiplayer strategy game to play with friends or against AI bots. Build your empire without letting it collapse under its own weight!

## About

Civilization is a strategy card-and-dice game about building a powerful empire while managing internal pressures such as population strain, civil unrest, rebellion, famine, and economic collapse. Military strength alone won't win—victory belongs to the ruler who can expand, dominate, and still keep their civilization stable.

## Getting Started

### For Players

See [GAMEPLAY_GUIDE.md](GAMEPLAY_GUIDE.md) for complete gameplay instructions including:
- All 7 game phases explained
- Player actions and strategies
- AI bot behavior and difficulty levels
- Victory conditions
- Trading and diplomacy
- War and rebellion mechanics

**Quick Play Guide:**
1. Choose **Single Player** mode to play against AI bots, or **Multiplayer** to play with friends
2. Set the number of bots (0-8) and difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
3. Create a game with the creator key or join an existing game
4. Start playing! Bots will automatically take their turns in STATE_ACTIONS phase

### For Developers

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed setup and deployment instructions.

Quick start:
1. Edit `firebase-config-loader.js` with your Firebase project configuration
2. Run a local web server: `python3 -m http.server 8080` or `npm start`
3. Open `test.html` in your browser to verify setup
4. Open `index.html` to start the game
5. Use creator key: `abcd` to create a game
6. Open another tab to join as a second player

**Note**: For production deployment, configure `firebase-config-loader.js` to fetch configuration from a secure endpoint rather than embedding it directly.

### Testing Your Setup

1. **Run Automated Tests**: Open `test.html` in your browser to verify:
   - All files are present
   - JavaScript structure is correct
   - Firebase configuration is valid
   
2. **Manual Testing**: See [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive testing procedures

### For Players

1. Get the game link from your host
2. Enter the game code provided by your host
3. Choose a display name
4. Wait for the host to start the game

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Firebase SDK**: Modular v10.7.1 (loaded via CDN)
- **Hosting**: Static site (can be hosted on Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Documented in package.json (external CDN dependencies)

## Security

- Firebase configuration is loaded via `firebase-config-loader.js` which supports:
  - Runtime injection from environment variables
  - Fetching from a secure backend endpoint
  - Direct configuration for development (not recommended for production)
- No secrets are committed to the repository (firebaseconfig.txt is .gitignored)
- All database writes use Firebase transactions for consistency
- See DEPLOYMENT.md for secure configuration methods

## Game Rules

See [civilization_game_manual.txt](civilization_game_manual.txt) for complete game rules including:
- Win conditions
