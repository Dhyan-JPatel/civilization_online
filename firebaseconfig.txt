Firebase Configuration - Placeholder
=====================================

This file previously contained sensitive Firebase configuration data.

Firebase configuration must now be provided at runtime via the deployment environment.

Set window.RUNTIME_FIREBASE_CONFIG before loading the application with an object containing:
{
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
}

Example deployment:
1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Inject configuration via build script or inline script tag before loading app
3. Ensure RUNTIME_FIREBASE_CONFIG is available on window object
